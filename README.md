## Features
Browser Alp comes a lot of features that coded just for developers:
- **Immersive View:** We want to display webpage more! So, we maked it bigger and bigger as we can, about 89.3% of just a laptop screen. Think that when you are using a bigger monitor!
- **Split View:** Wanna view 2 pages at same time? With Browser Alp, there is no limit on numbers! You can have infiniy pages on just one tab, even resize it!
- **Code Playground (On Development):** Are you a HTML developer? With just one click, you can open a bult-in editor and test your codes when you wanted to!
